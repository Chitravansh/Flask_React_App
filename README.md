# Flask React Project

This is a full-stack web application built using Flask (backend) and React (frontend). The project follows a RESTful API architecture and integrates both technologies for seamless client-server interaction.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- REST API with Flask
- Frontend with React and React Router
- Database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- State management with React Context/Redux
- Docker support (optional)
- Deployment-ready setup

## Technologies Used
### Backend (Flask)
- Flask
- Flask-RESTful
- Flask-JWT-Extended (for authentication)
- SQLAlchemy (database ORM)
- Marshmallow (for serialization)
- CORS support

### Frontend (React)
- React
- React Router
- CSS/Bootstrap (for styling)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js & npm
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
The backend will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend will start at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /api/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` - User login and token generation

### User Routes
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/user/<id>` - Get user details

### Additional Features (Customize as Needed)
- CRUD operations on a specific resource
- WebSockets integration

## Deployment
To deploy using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
For production, use Gunicorn (Flask) and serve React using Nginx.
